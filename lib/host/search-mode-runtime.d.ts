/**
 * dsh-web-tools — "Web Research mode" per-session turn policy (Search Mode).
 *
 * The layer sits ABOVE the provider layer: providers only execute web tools;
 * this module decides whether a turn must complete a web research call
 * (web_search OR web_fetch) before it may end. Everything is Host-owned so
 * browser refresh / session switch / relaunch cannot desync the button from
 * the real policy.
 *
 * Deploy strategy follows the proven `dsh-at-file` pattern (agent-scoped event
 * listeners): every agent-scoped listener is registered on that agent's scope
 * context inside `agent/created`, so `@deepseek-ai/dsh-scope` dispatches only
 * the matching agent's events to it.
 *   - `agent/pre-step` (waterfall): freeze the per-turn flag and inject one
 *     plugin-source UserMessage (official `createUserMessage`) on step 1.
 *   - `tools/result` (emit): receipt that a web_search or web_fetch ran.
 *     Completion — even a total provider failure — counts as "tried"; that is
 *     the requirement.
 *   - `agent/turn-stopping` (serial): no web research yet → `agent.steer()`
 *     once to continue; a second offense `agent.cancel()`s (no infinite loop).
 *
 * `SearchModeRuntime` is pure/framework-free so its state model is unit-testable.
 * @module
